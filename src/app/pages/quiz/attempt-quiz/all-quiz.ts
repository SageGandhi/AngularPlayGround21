It is soft and ranges in color from black to shades of brown and has very less carbon content. After millions of years, continued pressure and temperature convert lignite into sub-bituminous coal and has more carbon content than lignite.\n\nBituminous coal is harder and blacker than lignite and sub-bituminous coal due to its more carbon content in it. Anthracite is the most mature coal and thus has the highest carbon content of any type of coal"

While much of its use remained local, a lively trade developed along the North Sea coast. This also extended to the continental Rhineland, where bituminous coal was already used for the smelting of iron ore. After the Romans left Britain, in AD 410, there are few records of coal being used in the country until the end of the 12th century."

It is a natural discharge of the static electricity built up in storm clouds. Most lightning is formed as a part of thunderstorms. We know from observation of static electricity that static electrical discharges such as lightning are caused by separation of charges into positive and negative ions. Over time more of one charge builds until its natural attraction to the opposite charge causes it to migrate in an electrical discharge."

The layer of metal deposited has some desired property, which the metal of the object lacks. For example, chromium plating is done on many objects such as car parts, bath taps, kitchen gas burners, bicycle handlebars, wheel rims and many others.\nChromium has a shiny appearance. It does not corrode. It resists scratches. However, chromium is expensive and it may not be economical to make the whole object out of chromium. So the object is made from a cheaper metal and only a coating of chromium over it is deposited.\nHence, electroplating of chromium is done on objects like water taps and cycle bell to give them a shiny appearance and prevent them from corrosion. The statement is true."

The layer of metal deposited has some desired property, which the metal of the object lacks. For example, chromium plating is done on many objects such as car parts, bath taps, kitchen gas burners, bicycle handlebars, wheel rims and many others.\nChromium has a shiny appearance. It does not corrode. It resists scratches. However, chromium is expensive and it may not be economical to make the whole object out of chromium. So the object is made from a cheaper metal and only a coating of chromium over it is deposited.\nHence, electroplating of chromium is done on objects like water taps and cycle bell to give them a shiny appearance and prevent them from corrosion.

Clouds don't normally form in the stratosphere and these turn out to have the effect of concentrating the pollutants that break down the ozone, so speeding the process up."

                "text": "The total daily radiation decreases from equator to pole. Thus the Earth's surface should inherently be warmer at the equator than it is at the poles however Earth's axis of rotation tilts at a 23.5° away from the plane of rotation around the sun, that makes the poles point towards the sun during solstice time. During solstice, the pole pointing to the sun and the surrounding area receive radiation during all 24 hours of the day while the opposite pole does not receive any solar energy. This has the potential for making the poles as warm or warmer than the equator in their respective summer time if it were not for the large albedo of the Polar regions.\nThe atmosphere becomes less dense as altitude increases because there is less weight on the air molecules, making them less compressed. The air at lower altitudes is denser because it is pressed down by the weight of all the air molecules above.\nOption B"

This is because all the objects attached to the ground acts as ground or earthed objects. So lightning takes the shortest path to travel and thus, falls on the tallest object. If you're holding an umbrella in an area surrounded by taller buildings, it's not so risky. But If you are the only tall object in the place surrounding you, the lightning flash will fall on you. \nThus, carrying umbrella is not a good idea at all during thunderstorms."

Lightning damage to a car includes pitting, arcing and burning along with electrical system issues.\n\nRubber tires being insulator keep it from being grounded, which lessens the possibility that your car would get striked.\n\nIf your car had anything metal making direct contact with the earth, it would be more grounded, the more contact the more grounded.\n\nHence it is better to remain in car during thunderstorm fall."

The water available for consumption on earth is limited. Only 3% of the water on earth is freshwater. Most of the water is in the form of ice caps, glaciers and groundwater. All lakes, rivers and swamps combined include a very small part that is 0.3% of the earth's total freshwater reserves. Hence water should be used judiciously. So water day is celebrated every year to attract the attention of everybody towards the importance of conserving water. Thus the correct answer is option A."

But this extra precipitation is not spread evenly around the globe, and some places might actually get less precipitation than they used to get. That's because climate change causes shifts in air and ocean currents, which can change weather patterns."

And taking measures to keep that water clean by not allowing polluting activities to take place in our locality.\nIt can be done by two major processes:\n1. Rainwater harvesting\nIt is a method of collection and storage of rainwater into natural reservoirs or tanks, or the infiltration of surface water into subsurface aquifers.\n2. Groundwater harvesting \nGroundwater harvesting is a method to save water placed under the ground to control the groundwater flow in an aquifer, and to raise water table."

The water available for consumption on earth is limited. Only 3% of the water on earth is freshwater. Most of the water is in the form of ice caps, glaciers and groundwater. All lakes, rivers and swamps combined include a very small part that is 0.3% of the earth's total freshwater reserves. Hence water should be used judiciously. So water day is celebrated every year to attract the attention of everybody towards the importance of conserving water. Thus the correct answer is option A."

The water either goes through the cortex cells (between the root cells and the xylem vessels) or it bypasses them – going through their cell walls. After this, the water moves up the xylem vessels to the leaves through diffusion.\nSo, the answer is B."

Since COHb releases carbon monoxide slowly, less haemoglobin will be available to transport oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Conversion of most Hb to COHb results in death known medically as carboxyhemoglobinemia or carbon monoxide poisoning. Smaller amounts COHb lead to oxygen deprivation of the body causing tiredness, dizziness, suffocation and unconsciousness. \nTherefore, the correct answer is option D."

When the soil is too wet, water penetrates the plant through its roots and this creates pressure that forces the water to exit the plant in the form of droplets. This process doesn’t occur during the day, because the leaf’s stomata are open at that time. It occurs when the stomata close down, i.e. at night and water pressure begins to build up. Therefore, the droplets can be noticed when the sun comes up in the morning, before the drops evaporate.\nSo, the answer is B."

The main buffer in the blood contains a large amount of carbonic acid, a weak acid, and bicarbonate, a base. Together, they help to maintain the pH of the blood at 7.4. The bicarbonate buffer system is an acid-base mechanism to maintain the balance of pH in the blood, in order to support proper metabolic functions.\nSo the correct answer is C.\""

However, the majority of the soil splashed is not immediately lost from the field. Most of the splashed soil particles don't leave the field, they clog surface pores, which in turn reduces water infiltration, increases water runoff, and increases soil erosion.\nSo, the correct answer is option D."

The external nostrils up to the terminal bronchioles constitute the conducting part whereas the alveoli and their ducts form the respiratory or exchange part of the respiratory system.\nThe conducting part transports the atmospheric air to the alveoli. Exchange part is the site of actual diffusion of O and CO between blood and atmospheric air. The alveolus is richly supplied with blood capillaries which allow the exchange of gases through it.\nSo, the answer is C."

Anaerobic respiration also happens in cases where there is less supply of oxygen. eg. lactic acid synthesis in muscles during strenuous exercises.\nC. Aerobic respiration is far more energy-efficient than anaerobic respiration. Aerobic processes produce up to 38 ATP per glucose. Anaerobic processes yield only 2 ATP per glucose.\nD.
